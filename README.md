Hack Assembler
==============

An assembler for the Hack computer from the nand2tetris course that
you can read about [here](http://www.nand2tetris.org/).

This isn't brilliant code - I think it reflects the fact that I've
spent the last year or so working in functional languages where
defining new types is cheap and encouraged!
